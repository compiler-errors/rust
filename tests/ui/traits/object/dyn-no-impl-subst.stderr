error[E0038]: the trait `Copy` cannot be made into an object
  --> $DIR/dyn-no-impl-subst.rs:14:31
   |
LL | const G: &dyn Copy = unsafe { Transmute { t: 1 }.u };
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Copy` cannot be made into an object
   |
   = note: the trait cannot be made into an object because it requires `Self: Sized`
   = note: for a trait to be "dyn-compatible" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>
   = note: required for the cast from `&'static Vtable` to `&'static (dyn Copy + 'static)`
